            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>
                One of the skills I am most proud of is my ability to debug. I have always been interested in solving problems, especially when it comes to technology. Debugging helps identify and fix issues in software or systems. It was challenging at first, but over time, I’ve learned how to understand how things work and what went wrong. Debugging requires patience, and I’ve learned to take my time and not rush through it. It’s like solving a puzzle, where every piece must fit perfectly for everything to work. When debugging, I pay close attention to every detail. In technology, small mistakes can lead to big problems, so I carefully check each line of code and how it interacts with other parts. I also use different tools to find the issue. I try various approaches, whether checking error messages or running tests, until I find the root cause. This skill is vital in software development, and I’ve gotten better at it over time. Being a detailed person also helps me when debugging. I’ve always liked paying attention to the little things, which helps me in many areas of my life. In technology, the smallest issues can be the hardest to find, so attention to detail is essential. I take the time to look carefully at systems and check every part of a program. This mindset has also helped me in school, where I make sure I understand every part of a lesson before moving on. When I debug, I break down bigger problems into smaller parts. This approach helps me focus on each one individually. I also document my progress to keep track of my work. This detail-oriented mindset helps me stay organized in everything I do. It has made me more methodical in solving problems, and I know it will continue to help me in the future. In the future, I want to keep improving my debugging skills. I plan to learn more about programming languages and debugging tools.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                Gaming has always been one of my favorite hobbies, but lately, I don't play as much as I used to. Before, I spent a lot of time playing games like Valorant, Need for Speed, and Red Dead Redemption 2. It was something I really enjoyed, but now, I find myself playing less often. Even though I still like gaming, my focus has changed, and I don’t have as much time for it anymore. I used to play Valorant almost every day, always working on my aim and teamwork. It was so much fun to play with my friends and feel the excitement of winning. The game kept me engaged with its fast pace and strategies, but now, I rarely play. I miss the fun I had, but I just don’t have the time to play as much. Need for Speed was another game I enjoyed because of my love for cars. I liked customizing my cars and racing them through different tracks. The thrill of pushing my car to the limit made it even more exciting. But now, I don’t play as often because life has gotten busier, and I have other things to focus on. Red Dead Redemption was a game I enjoyed because it let me experience life in the Wild West. The story was amazing, and exploring the vast open world felt really real. But now, I rarely have time to get back into that world. Although I still appreciate the game, I don’t get the chance to play it like I used to. In the end, gaming used to be a big part of my life, but now I only play occasionally. It’s still a great way to relax, but my priorities have changed. Even though I play less, I’ll always remember the fun moments and adventures from these games. I might not game as much as before, but when I do, it still brings me joy and helps me unwind.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                As I continue learning more about technology, I have become really interested in cybersecurity and QA testing. My curiosity about computers started when I was young, and I was always amazed by how they worked. Over time, I became more curious about how systems are managed, secured, and maintained. Cybersecurity caught my attention because I see how cyberattacks happen everywhere. I realized how important it is to protect networks, manage user access, and ensure that systems are always secure. Instead of hacking, I am more interested in the role of an administrator who manages security, updates systems, and prevents cyber threats. Aside from cybersecurity, I also got interested in QA testing. I enjoy checking software for bugs and finding ways to improve it. QA testing is important because it ensures that applications and systems function properly. I like testing software and making sure there are no problems before users interact with it. It requires patience, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills, which I find exciting. The challenge of making software work smoothly motivates me to learn different testing techniques and tools. My interest in cybersecurity and QA testing grew stronger when I learned about how businesses manage their IT infrastructure. I started researching how system administrators handle security updates, monitor networks, and prevent unauthorized access. This made me curious about managing servers, firewalls, and database security. I also got interested in automated testing, which helps software developers find bugs faster. I believe that both cybersecurity and QA testing are very important today, especially because people rely on technology so much. In the future, I want to gain real experience in these fields by working on projects and getting certifications. I plan to study system administration, network security, and different software testing techniques. The idea of managing IT systems and ensuring their security excites me. I know that both fields require continuous learning, and I am willing to do that. My goal is to help improve the tech industry by keeping systems secure and ensuring that applications run smoothly. Pursuing cybersecurity and QA testing will allow me to use my curiosity, analytical skills, and problem-solving abilities. I am excited to keep learning and improving in this field.
